# Dark YouTube
Just to clarify... This is not actively being worked on. I will see any issues that are made, and will try to get them fixed. But full updates may come slow.
Every time I see something that annoys me, I will update the list of things to do. [See list here](https://github.com/XDRosenheim/ChromeExtension#to-be-worked-on)
